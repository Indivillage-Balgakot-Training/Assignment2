Visual Studio Code is a source-code editor that can be used with a variety of programming languages, including C, 
C#, C++, Fortran, Go, Java, JavaScript, Node.js, Python, Rust, and Julia.[17][18][19][20][21] Visual Studio Code 
employs the same editor component (codenamed "Monaco") used in Azure DevOps (formerly called "Visual Studio Online" 
and "Visual Studio Team Services").[22] The downloadable version of Visual Studio Code is built on the Electron 
framework,[23] which is used to develop Node.js web applications that run on the Blink layout engine. Visual 
Studio Code for the Web is a browser-based version of the editor that can be used to edit both local files and 
remote repositories (on GitHub and Microsoft Azure) without installing the full program.[24] It is officially 
supported and hosted by Microsoft and can be accessed at vscode.dev. Out of the box, Visual Studio Code includes 
basic support for most common programming languages. This basic support includes syntax highlighting, bracket 
matching, code folding, and configurable snippets. Visual Studio Code also ships with IntelliSense for JavaScript, 
TypeScript, JSON, CSS, and HTML, as well as debugging support for Node.js. Support for additional languages can be 
provided by freely available extensions on the VS Code Marketplace.[25] Instead of a project system, it allows users 
to open one or more directories, which can then be saved in workspaces for future reuse. This allows it to operate as
a language-agnostic code editor for any language. It supports many programming languages and a set of features that 
differs per language. Unwanted files and folders can be excluded from the project tree via settings. Many Visual 
Studio Code features are not exposed through menus or the user interface but can be accessed via the command palette.
[26] The command palette is able to execute virtually every feature the graphical interface supports, making it very 
keyboard-accessible.[27] Visual Studio Code can be extended via extensions,[28] available through a central repository. 
This includes additions to the editor[29] and language support.[26] A notable feature is the ability to create 
extensions that add support for new languages, themes, debuggers, time travel debuggers, perform static code analysis, 
and add code linters using the Language Server Protocol.[30] Source control is a built-in feature of Visual Studio 
Code. It has a dedicated tab inside of the menu bar where users can access version control settings and view changes 
made to the current project. To use the feature, Visual Studio Code must be linked to any supported version control 
system (Git, Apache Subversion, Perforce, etc.). This allows users to create repositories as well as to make push and 
pull requests directly from the Visual Studio Code program.
